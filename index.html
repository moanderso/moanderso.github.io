<h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello GUY Stans</h1>
    <h1>GUY</h1>
    <h1>THE MAN,THE CHEF, THE LEGEND</h1>
    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
  <font color="red">
    <p>A future colorful culinary personality, Guy Ramsey Ferry was born on January 22, 1968, later changing his last name to the original family spelling "Fieri." He opened up his first food business at the age of 10, operating his own pretzel cart. After college, he worked as a restaurant manager, then started his own restaurant with a partner in 1996. In 2006, Fieri began his TV career after winning Next Food Network Star. Today, he hosts several food-themed shows.</p>
  
  
  <p>Growing up in Ferndale, California, Guy Fieri developed a passion for food and entrepreneurship early on. He and his father built a special pretzel cart when he was 10 years old. Fieri eventually earned enough money from selling pretzels to fund the adventure of a lifetime; at the age of 16, Fieri spent a year studying in France, which furthered his culinary education. </p>

<p>While attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Fieri worked several different restaurant jobs. He even served as a flambé captain for a time. After earning his degree in hospitality management, Fieri continued working in restaurants. He put his degree to work at a Stouffer's restaurant, and later became a district manager for Louise's Trattoria.</p>

<p>In 1996, Fieri started his first restaurant with partner Steve Gruber. The pair launched an Italian eatery called Johnny Garlic's in Santa Rosa, California. They eventually open two more locations. Fieri and Gruber branched out from Italian fare to launch Tex Wasabi's in 2003. The restaurant is a fusion of Southern BBQ and California-style sushi.</p>

<p>Egged on by his friends, Fieri sent in a videotape to the reality show Next Food Network Star in 2005. He told the network that he likes to "live big, laugh hard, and cook wild" in his audition video. His rock 'n' roll attitude helped earn him a chance to compete, beating out more than 1,000 other entrants. Fieri tackled challenges from such television culinary stars as Giada De Laurentiis, Paula Deen, Rachael Ray and Bobby Flay. In 2006, he emerged victorious, becoming the second person to win the cooking reality show.</p>

<p>After being crowned the Next Food Network Star, Fieri launched his first television series, Guy's Big Bite in 2006, offering viewers lots of bold flavors. The bleached-blond chef took his love of food on the road for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, which also debuted in 2006. On the show, Fieri travels the country in search of tasty, unpretentious eats. He next took on a more traditional-style cooking show format with Guy Off the Hook in 2008, in which he cooked in front of a live audience. Over the years, Fieri has emerged as an unusual culinary icon with his trademark spiky hair, tattoos, bowling shirts and skateboarder shorts.</p>

<p>In 2009, Fieri merged his love of food and music to create the Guy Fieri Roadshow. This "food-a-palooza" tour featured a DJ, drinks and cooking demonstrations. He has also written several books, including 2011's Guy Fieri Food: More Than 150 Off-The-Hook Recipes.</p>

<p>Expanding beyond cooking, Fieri became a game show host in 2010. He guides contestants through numerous 60-second challenges on Minute to Win It.</p></font>

    <font color="purple"> <h3>"Peace, love and taco grease!"</h3>
     <h3>“You can find that dictionary in the Flavourtown library.”</h3>
      <h3>“If it tastes really good and it’s funky, it’s funkalicious.”</h3>
    <h3>“That’s the definition of stupid in Flavourtown. Stupid in a good way.”</h3></p> </font>
    
    
   <font color="green"><h1> CATCHPHRASES </h1></font>
    <font color="maroon">
<p><strong>Bomb-dot-com tasty</strong></p>
<p>This is one of Fieri’s go-to expressions in the earlier seasons of Triple D, where his campy bro-ishness was at its peak. The etymology seems to come from the late ‘90s slang “the bomb,” meaning good. It's coupled with the smooth-rhyming “dot com” to signify that we are close to reaching technological singularity and, even if we wanted to, we could never unplug from The Matrix. Also, you’ll notice that the more outlandish the descriptor, the less it seems that Fieri actually likes the food.</p>

<p>Example: <i>You know what, it might just be a mound of oil-logged Pillsbury crescent dough, but it’s bomb-dot-com tasty, amigo.</i></p>

<p><strong>Dynamite</strong></p>
<p>The earliest usage of the phrase “dynamite” as a positive descriptor (though pronounced with an affected cadence) is credited (by me) to actor Jimmie Walker, most well known for playing J.J. on the hit 1970s sitcom, Good Times. As it pertains to food, the implication is that the flavor is so explosive, it mimics the destructive blast power of actual TNT. It is not clear which meaning Guy Fieri intends to invoke, but “dynamite” is one of his more generic terms of approval.</p>

<p> Example: <i>When the ham fat combines with the Dr. Pepper—that’s dynamite, brother.</i></p>

<p><strong>Festival of funk</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the funk is so intense that it cannot be contained in one dish. Sometimes that funk bleeds out into several satellite funks, combining together to form a festival of funk. This phrase, like many of Fieri’s, is generally interchangeable with several other positive, flavor-based descriptors, but it is most readily coupled with food from non-Western cultures.</p> 

  <p>Example: <i>And then the fish sauce goes into the pot and it comes out as a whole festival of funk.</i></p>
  
<p><strong>Flavortown</strong></p>
<p>Flavortown is King Fieri’s fiefdom, where the rivers flow thick with gravy and fast-casual salad chains are chased away by violent meatstick-wielding mobs. Some say Flavortown doesn’t really exist, that it’s more of an idea that lives in our hearts. But let me assure you, like heaven, Flavortown is for real. To get there, all you need is a bucket of trans fats, a childlike sense of wonderment, and a whole lot of bath salts.</p>

<p>Example: <i>We’re takin’ you on a road rockin’ trip down to Flavortown, where the gravitational force of bacon warps the laws of space and time.</i></p>

<p><strong>Funkalicious</strong></p>
<p>A portmanteau of “funky” and “delicious,” Fieri reserves this adjective for any food that confuses him. Sometimes things get so confusing, you just have to make words up. We’ve all been there.</p>

<p>Example: <i>I may not agree with your dietary lifestyle, but those vegan peanut butter crabcakes are funkalicious.</i></p>

<p><strong>Gangster</strong></p>
<p>In the Fieriverse, anything can be gangster. Did you dry-age your own heritage pig prosciutto for three years? That’s gangster. Did you whisk hot sauce into mayonnaise and call it “Awesome Sauce”? That’s gangster, too. Gun down a fellow restaurateur over a turf dispute? I mean, it hasn’t happened yet on the show (that we know of), but, yeah, that’s also gangster.</p> 

<p>Example:<i>Hello, fellow youths, would you like a slice of this gangster loaf of meat?</i></p>

<p><strong>Hot frisbee of fun </strong></p>
<p>More than just a rejected title for an Ultimate Frisbee-themed porno (would watch), Fieri uses this phrase to refer to any circular food (frisbees are indeed circular) that could be considered both hot and fun. That means pancakes, hamburgers, tostadas, and also any food served on a circular plate. Most foods are hot frisbees of fun.</p>

<p>Example: <i>These cheesy pork fat pancakes are a hot frisbee of fun coming straight for your dome, muchacho.</i></p>

<p><strong>Hot tub in Flavortown</strong></p>
<p>Flavortown has the most hot tubs per capita in the world. That’s totally a thing. Seriously. Everyone knows that. Look it up. Any time Guy Fieri sees a large pot of hot liquid—most often soups, stews, or, occasionally, treat-filled deep fryers—it reminds him of his realm’s glorious obsession with capitalist luxuries. It pleases Him. He is a proud if vainglorious king. Anyways, yeah, he says this about literally any hot, wet food, and it’s hilarious.</p>

<p>Example:<i> That industrial-sized vat of lobster tater-tot bisque is lookin’ like a Hot tub in Flavortown.</i></p>

<p><strong>Joint</strong></p>
<p>In Fieri-speak, a joint is any establishment that serves food. The term is most often coupled with adjectives “funky” and “little” to foreshadow a restaurant’s uniqueness.</p>

<p>Example:<i> I’m here in Waxahachie, Texas checking out this funky little joint serving up—that’s right—chicken-fried armadillo nuggets.</i></p>

<p><strong>Lights-out delicious</strong></p>
<p>This food is so delicious, that it will literally cause you to lose consciousness. You will black out, wake up somewhere near the Guatemalan border, probably naked and inexplicably covered in henna tattoos and nicotine patches. Fieri only uses this phrase for reality-bendingly dope food. There are times when the food is so good that he ditches some of the more outlandish catch phrases, wipes the whimsy from his face, and gets real with the chef with his compliments. This is one of those times.</p>

<p>Example: <i>Seriously, man, I gotta tell you, for real this time, I’m not even messing around—those corned beef taquitos are lights-out delicious.</i></p>

<p><strong>Out of bounds</strong></p>
<p>When the flavor is so explosive, it cannot be contained in a regulation sized football field (120 yards by 53.3 yards). Of course, there is no way to physically measure diffusion of flavor, so Fieri relies mainly on guess work and pitbull-like instincts here.</p>  

  <p>Example:<i> This pickle soup has at least 6,396 square yards of flavor, forcing it out of bounds.</i></p>

<p><strong>Put it on a flip flop</strong></p>
<p>In the later episodes of Triple D, Fieri uses this as a shorthand for “This food is so packed with flavor that you could put it on a flip flop and it would still be palatable.” In 26 seasons of the show, Fieri has yet to eat an actual flip flop, signaling that this may be hyperbole. However, hope still remains that within the next 75 seasons, Fieri will eat an actual sandal. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Example:<i> That nacho lasagna is bombtastic! Put it on a flip flop, my man!</i></p></font>
