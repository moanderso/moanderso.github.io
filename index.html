    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a student enrolled in Eugene Lang college at The New School.
      I am interested in exploring more art dynamics by expanding my coding skills. Coding to me means making something from noothing. 
      The art of writing numbers and letters to create a page filled with colors and ideas hand picked from my head is something extremely faciating.
      While my experience is minimal, I plan to make the most of it.
    <h3>My favorite color is green</h3>
     <h3>I am an Aries</h3>
      <h3>I love food</h3>
    <h3>I am interested in the study of languages</h3></p> 
    
    
    <h1> MORE coding</h1>
    <p> During my time at Lang, I jumped into coding, taking a Digital Psyops class. 
      Seeing these mashups of letters and numbers baffled me. I had seen code before, 
      but never to the expent of gaming, actual programming, etc. During my second semester, 
      I dove into the coding pond again, taking a simulations and cybernetics class dedicated 
      to the creative aspect of gaming and game making itself. </p>
