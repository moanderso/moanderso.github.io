    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am currently a student enrolled in Eugene Lang college at The New School.
      I am interested in exploring more art dynamics by applying to the BA/BFA program in order to 
      expand upon my creative freedom, something The New School has granted me.</p> 
    
    
    <h3>My coding experience</h3>
    <p> During my time at Lang, I jumped into coding, taking a Digital Psyops class. 
      Seeing these mashups of letters and numbers baffled me. I had seen code before, 
      but never to the expent of gaming, actual programming, etc. During my second semester, 
      I dove into the coding pond again, taking a simulations and cybernetics class dedicated 
      to the creative aspect of gaming and game making itself. </p>
